## 8.Web.config vs Machine.config
Web.config is application-level, Machine.config is machine-level.

## 9.Authentication and Authorization
Authentication verifies identity, authorization checks access rights.

## 10.HTTP Modules and Handlers

## 19.Areas in MVC
Areas organize large applications into modules.

## 20.Partial Views and Layouts
Partial views reuse UI, layouts define page structure.

## 21.Bundling and Minification
They reduce file size and improve performance.

## 22.Strongly Typed Views
Strongly typed views use models with compile-time checking.

## 23.HTML Helpers vs Tag Helpers
HTML Helpers use methods, Tag Helpers use HTML-like syntax.

## 24.AJAX in MVC
AJAX updates parts of a page without full reload.

## 25.Unit Testing in MVC

## 37.SignalR in Core
SignalR enables real-time communication.

## 38.gRPC in ASP.NET Core
