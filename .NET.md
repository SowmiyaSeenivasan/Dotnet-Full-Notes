## ASP.NET

## What is ASP.NET?
ASP.NET is a framework for building dynamic web applications on .NET.

##  Web Forms vs MVC vs Core
Web Forms is event-based, MVC is pattern-based, Core is cross-platform and modern.

## Page Lifecycle in Web Forms
Page lifecycle defines the sequence of events from request to response.

##  Postback Concept
Postback sends page data back to the server for processing.

##  State Management
State management stores user data across requests.

## Global.asax Usage
Global.asax handles application-level events.

##  Master Pages
Master pages provide a common layout for multiple pages.

##  Web.config vs Machine.config
Web.config is application-level, Machine.config is machine-level.

##  Authentication and Authorization
Authentication verifies identity, authorization checks access rights.

## HTTP Modules and Handlers
Modules handle requests globally, handlers process specific requests.

## Custom Error Handling
Custom errors provide user-friendly error pages.

# ASP.NET MVC

## MVC Architecture
MVC separates application into Model, View, and Controller.

##  MVC vs Web Forms
MVC offers better control and testability than Web Forms.

## Routing in MVC
Routing maps URLs to controller actions.

##  Attribute vs Convention Routing
Attribute routing uses attributes, convention routing uses patterns.

##  ActionResult vs JsonResult vs ViewResult
They return different response types from actions.

##  TempData vs ViewBag vs ViewData
They pass data from controller to view differently.

##  Filters in MVC
Filters execute code before or after action methods.

##  Areas in MVC
Areas organize large applications into modules.

##  Partial Views and Layouts
Partial views reuse UI, layouts define page structure.

##  Bundling and Minification
They reduce file size and improve performance.

##  Strongly Typed Views
Strongly typed views use models with compile-time checking.

##  HTML Helpers vs Tag Helpers
HTML Helpers use methods, Tag Helpers use HTML-like syntax.

##  AJAX in MVC
AJAX updates parts of a page without full reload.

##  Unit Testing in MVC
Unit testing verifies controller logic independently.

# ASP.NET Core

##  Core Pipeline and Middleware
Middleware processes HTTP requests sequentially.

##  Kestrel Server
Kestrel is the cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core.

## Startup.cs and Program.cs
They configure services and application pipeline.

##  Dependency Injection in Core
Core has built-in dependency injection support.

##  Logging in ASP.NET Core
Logging records application events and errors.

##  Appsettings.json Usage
Appsettings.json stores configuration settings.

##  Configuration Providers
Providers read configuration from files, environment, or secrets.

##  Hosting Models
In-process runs inside IIS, out-of-process runs separately.

##  Razor Pages vs MVC
Razor Pages are page-focused, MVC is controller-focused.

## Blazor Server vs WebAssembly
Server runs on server, WebAssembly runs in browser.

##  Minimal APIs
Minimal APIs build lightweight HTTP APIs with minimal code.

##  SignalR in Core
SignalR enables real-time communication.

##  gRPC in ASP.NET Core
gRPC provides high-performance remote procedure calls.

##  Swagger Integration
Swagger documents and tests APIs.

## API Versioning
API versioning manages multiple API versions.
