#  C# Important Concepts

## 1. Features of C#
C# is a modern, object-oriented, type-safe language with automatic memory management.

## 2. Value Types vs Reference Types
Value types store data directly, while reference types store memory addresses.

## 3. Boxing and Unboxing
Boxing converts value type to object and unboxing converts object back to value type.

## 4. Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control the visibility of classes and members.

## 5. Constructors
Constructors initialize objects when a class instance is created.

## 6. Destructor in C#
Destructor releases unmanaged resources before object is destroyed.

## 7. Method Overloading vs Overriding
Overloading changes method parameters, overriding changes method implementation.

## 8. Sealed Class and Sealed Method
Sealed prevents inheritance or overriding.

## 9. Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
Abstract classes can have implementation, interfaces cannot (before C# 8).

## 10. Virtual and Override Keywords
Virtual allows overriding, override provides new implementation.

## 11. Static Members and Static Class
Static members belong to class, not to object.

## 12. Partial Classes
Partial class allows splitting a class into multiple files.

## 13. Nested Classes
A class defined inside another class is a nested class.

## 14. Structs in C#
Structs are value types used to store small data.

## 15. Enums in C#
Enum represents a set of named constants.

## 16. Nullable Types
Nullable types allow value types to store null.

## 17. Properties
Properties provide controlled access to class fields.

## 18. Indexers
Indexers allow objects to be accessed like arrays.

## 19. Extension Methods
Extension methods add methods to existing classes without modifying them.

## 20. Anonymous Types
Anonymous types create objects without defining a class.
