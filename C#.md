#  C# 

## 1. Features of C#
C# is a modern, object-oriented, type-safe language with automatic memory management.

## 2. Value Types vs Reference Types
Value types store data directly, while reference types store memory addresses.

## 3. Boxing and Unboxing
Boxing converts value type to object and unboxing converts object back to value type.

## 4. Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control the visibility of classes and members.

## 5. Constructors
Constructors initialize objects when a class instance is created.

## 6. Destructor in C#
Destructor releases unmanaged resources before object is destroyed.

## 7. Method Overloading vs Overriding
Overloading changes method parameters, overriding changes method implementation.

## 8. Sealed Class and Sealed Method
Sealed prevents inheritance or overriding.

## 9. Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
Abstract classes can have implementation, interfaces cannot (before C# 8).

## 10. Virtual and Override Keywords
Virtual allows overriding, override provides new implementation.

## 11. Static Members and Static Class
Static members belong to class, not to object.

## 12. Partial Classes
Partial class allows splitting a class into multiple files.

## 13. Nested Classes
A class defined inside another class is a nested class.

## 14. Structs in C#
Structs are value types used to store small data.

## 15. Enums in C#
Enum represents a set of named constants.

## 16. Nullable Types
Nullable types allow value types to store null.

## 17. Properties
Properties provide controlled access to class fields.

## 18. Indexers
Indexers allow objects to be accessed like arrays.

## 19. Extension Methods
Extension methods add methods to existing classes without modifying them.

## 20. Anonymous Types
Anonymous types create objects without defining a class.

## 21. Delegates and Multicast Delegates
Delegates are type-safe function pointers and multicast delegates call multiple methods.

## 22. Events in C#
Events provide a way to notify subscribers when something happens.

## 23. Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions are concise anonymous functions written using `=>`.

## 24. LINQ Basics
LINQ provides query operations like Select, Where, OrderBy, GroupBy, and Join.

## 25. LINQ vs Stored Procedures
LINQ runs in application code, while stored procedures run in the database.

## 26. Async and Await
Async and await enable non-blocking asynchronous programming.

## 27. Task Parallel Library (TPL)
TPL simplifies parallel and asynchronous programming using tasks.

## 28. Thread vs Task
Thread is a low-level unit of execution, while Task is a higher-level abstraction.

## 29. Reflection in C#
Reflection allows inspecting metadata and types at runtime.

## 30. Attributes
Attributes add metadata to code elements.

## 31. Generics
Generics provide type safety and code reusability.

## 32. IEnumerable vs ICollection vs IList vs IQueryable
They differ in functionality, mutability, and query execution.

## 33. Garbage Collection in C#
Garbage collection automatically frees unused managed memory.

## 34. IDisposable and Using Statement
IDisposable releases unmanaged resources and using ensures automatic cleanup.

## 35. Memory Leaks in C#
Memory leaks occur when objects are not properly released.

## 36. Exception Handling and Custom Exceptions
Exceptions handle runtime errors and custom exceptions define application-specific errors.

## 37. Try-Catch-Finally vs Try-Finally
Try-catch-finally handles errors, while try-finally ensures cleanup.

## 38. String vs StringBuilder
String is immutable, while StringBuilder is mutable.

## 39. Record Types
Records are immutable reference types for data-centric models.

## 40. Tuples and ValueTuple
Tuples store multiple values without creating a class.

## 41. Dynamic Type in C#
Dynamic resolves type at runtime instead of compile time.

## 42. Var vs Dynamic vs Object
Var is compile-time typed, dynamic is runtime typed, object is base type.

## 43. Async Void vs Async Task
Async void is for events, async Task is awaitable.

## 44. Deadlocks in Async Code
Deadlocks occur when async tasks wait on each other indefinitely.

## 45. Dependency Injection in C#
Dependency Injection reduces coupling by injecting dependencies.
